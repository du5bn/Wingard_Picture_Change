# Wingard_Picture_Change
# Takes the clever (or any) students.csv and uses the Last_name, First_name and Student_id headers to search a folder named "Student Name Pictures" with all the .jpg pictures in it. 
# When it finds a name in one of those file names it gets the ID number for that student and puts the file in a different folder with only the id number for that filename. 
# It uses Last_name then First_name with an underscore in the middle for the search and ignores the rest of the filename since this is how Wingard formats the file names.
